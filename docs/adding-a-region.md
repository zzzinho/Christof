# Adding a region

English | [한국어](adding-a-region.ko.md)

Regions cannot be added from the app. You change the design and the code, then build the app yourself. There are two regions now: Seoul and Busan.

Each region has one landmark in the distance outside the window. Everything else (the room, the person, the cat, and the events) is the same in every region.

## 1. Design the far view

The design files are in [`design/`](../design/). Run [hunsu](https://github.com/zzzinho/hunsu) in that folder to open them.

1. In `design/00-base.html`, add a drawing function to `FAR_VIEWS`, and map the region's Korean name to it in `REGION_VIEWS`. A region that is not in `REGION_VIEWS` gets the default view: a ridge with apartment blocks.
2. Copy `design/01-busan.html` to `design/NN-<region>.html` and change only `REGION` (the name and the design intents). The page fetches the drawing code from `00-base.html`, so open it through hunsu, not as a file.
3. In `design/DESIGN.md`, add a row to the table of regional far views (지역별 먼 풍경): what the landmark is and why it was chosen. Draw only one landmark per region. The widget is small, and two landmarks are both lost.

## 2. Port it to the app

The drawing code in `ChristofKit` is a port of the design's JavaScript, with the same names and order, so it draws the same dots.

1. Port the drawing function to a `FarView` type in `ChristofKit/Sources/ChristofKit/Rendering/Layers/FarViews.swift`.
2. Add the region to `KoreaRegions.all` in `ChristofKit/Sources/ChristofKit/Countries/Korea/KoreaRegions.swift`:

   ```swift
   region("daegu", LocalizedName(en: "Daegu", ko: "대구"), 35.87028, 128.59111, radius: 15_000, RegionLooks(far: DaeguView())),
   ```

   - The id (`KR.daegu`) is saved in widget settings. Do not change it after a release.
   - The Korean name must match the key in `REGION_VIEWS`. The design comparison uses it to pick the far view.
   - The coordinates are the city center. Weather is fetched for this point. The current regions use the center point from [Open-Meteo geocoding](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api).
   - `radius` is the rough distance in meters from the center to the city boundary. When a widget's region is Auto, the app picks the region whose circle contains the device's location. Outside every circle, it uses the default region.
   - The first region in the list is the default region.

The widget's region list and the app's region picker read the regions from `CountryRegistry`, so no other code changes.

## 3. Check

To compare the new far view with the design, add a scene with the new region to `scenarios` in `ChristofKit/Sources/ChristofSnapshots/main.swift`. Then run:

```sh
swift test --package-path ChristofKit
swift run --package-path ChristofKit ChristofSnapshots /tmp/christof-snapshots
node ChristofKit/Scripts/compare-design.mjs /tmp/christof-snapshots design/00-base.html
```

The comparison redraws every snapshot with the design's JavaScript. The palette and every grid must match. Open the PNGs in the snapshot folder to look at the result too.

Build the app with:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Christof.xcodeproj -scheme Christof -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Adding a country

1. Make a folder `ChristofKit/Sources/ChristofKit/Countries/<Country>/` with a type that conforms to `CountryProfile`: the country code, regions, holidays (`occasions`), and seasons.
2. Add the profile to `CountryRegistry.standard`. Shared code does not change.

A holiday is one `Occasion` value: a date rule (`OccasionRule`) and the looks for each part of the scene. See `Countries/Korea/KoreaOccasions.swift` for examples. Draw each country with its own landscape and customs, so it is never mistaken for another country. `design/DESIGN.md` has the rules.
